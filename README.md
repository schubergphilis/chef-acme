ACME cookbook
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schubergphilis/chef-acme.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/schubergphilis/chef-acme)
[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/acme.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/acme)

Automatically get/renew free and trusted certificates from Let's Encrypt (letsencrypt.org).
ACME is the Automated Certificate Management Environment protocol used by Let's Encrypt.

Attributes
----------
### default
* `node['acme']['contact']` - Contact information, default empty. Set to `mailto:your@email.com`.
* `node['acme']['endpoint']` - ACME server endpoint, default `https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org`. Set to `https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org` if you want to use the Let's Encrypt staging environment and corresponding certificates.
* `node['acme']['renew']` - Days before the certificate expires at which the certificate will be renewed, default `30`.
* `node['acme']['source_ips']` - IP addresses used by Let's Encrypt to verify the TLS certificates, it will change over time. This attribute is for firewall purposes. Allow these IPs for HTTP (tcp/80).
* `node['acme']['private_key']` - Private key content of registered account.
* `node['acme']['key_size']` - Default private key size used when resource property is not. Must be one out of: 2048, 3072, 4096. Defaults to 2048.

Recipes
-------
### default
Installs the required acme-client rubygem.

Usage
-----
Use the `acme_certificate` provider to request a certificate. The webserver for the domain for which you are requesting a certificate must be running on the local server. Currently only the http validation method is supported. Provide the path to your `wwwroot` for the specified domain.

```ruby
acme_certificate 'test.example.com' do
  crt               '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.crt'
  chain             '/etc/ssl/test.example.com-chain.crt'
  key               '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.key'
  wwwroot           '/var/www'
end
```

In case your webserver needs an already existing certificate when installing a new server you will have a bootstrap problem. Webserver cannot start without certificate, but the certificate cannot be requested without the running webserver. To overcome this a self-signed certificate can be generated with the `acme_selfsigned` provider.

```ruby
acme_selfsigned 'test.example.com' do
  crt     '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.crt'
  chain   '/etc/ssl/test.example.com-chain.crt'
  key     '/etc/ssl/test.example.com.key'
end
```

A working example can be found in the included `acme_client` test cookbook.

Example
-------
To generate a certificate for an apache2 website you can use code like this:

```ruby
# Include the recipe to install the gems
include_recipe 'acme'

# Set up contact information. Note the mailto: notation
node.set['acme']['contact'] = ['mailto:me@example.com']
# Real certificates please...
node.set['acme']['endpoint'] = 'https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org'

site = "example.com"
sans = ["www.#{site}"]

# Generate a self-signed if we don't have a cert to prevent bootstrap problems
acme_selfsigned "#{site}" do
  crt     "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.crt"
  key     "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.key"
  chain    "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.pem"
  owner   "apache"
  group   "apache"
  notifies :restart, "service[apache2]", :immediate
end

# Set up your webserver here...

# Get and auto-renew the certificate from Let's Encrypt
acme_certificate "#{site}" do
  crt               "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.crt"
  key               "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.key"
  chain             "/etc/httpd/ssl/#{site}.pem"
  wwwroot           "/var/www/#{site}/htdocs/"
  notifies :restart, "service[apache2]"
  alt_names sans
end
```

Testing
-------
The kitchen includes a `boulder` server to run the integration tests with, so testing can run locally without interaction with the online API's.
